# API contracts and schemas

**Control family:** api  
**Control document:** API-01  
**Requirement trace:** ED-004, SO-002–SO-005, SO-011, PA-010  
**Status:** Normative project control

## Control objective

These controls govern **api contracts and schemas**. The intended outcome is that every applicable requirement is implemented at the correct system boundary, produces the specified behavior under normal and adverse conditions, and can be verified from current repository or runtime evidence.

## Applicability

This control applies to every new or modified production component, interface, build or deployment artifact, operational procedure, and test within the **api** domain. Where a clause is conditional, its stated condition defines when it applies. Legacy behavior is brought into scope when changed or when an approved migration specifically addresses it.

## Normative requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 and RFC 8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

### API-01.01 — Maintain a machine-readable OpenAPI description for every public HTTP

The project MUST maintain a machine-readable OpenAPI description for every public HTTP API. The project MUST also treat it as a reviewed contract that describes paths, methods, schemas, validation constraints, authentication, authorization, status codes, error bodies, pagination, and streaming behavior.

### API-01.02 — Keep request and response schemas in a dedicated API

The project MUST keep request and response schemas in a dedicated API schema module. The project MUST also group handlers by user-facing functionality. A handler MAY parse transport input, invoke a domain interface, and serialize a response; it MUST NOT own inference, persistence, registry policy, or cross-service business logic.

### API-01.03 — Use one stable error envelope

The project MUST use one stable error envelope. The project MUST also include a safe error code and correlation identifier; return actionable client guidance without leaking stack traces, filesystem paths, secrets, internal service names, or dependency errors.

### API-01.04 — Define compatibility for every endpoint

The project MUST define compatibility for every endpoint. Additive changes preserve existing semantics. Breaking changes require an explicit API version/deprecation plan, a migration window, and consumer-facing release notes.

### API-01.05 — Generate reference documentation from the contract when practical

The project SHOULD generate reference documentation from the contract when practical. Handwritten endpoint examples MUST be checked against the current contract and implementation.

## Prohibited conditions

- The project MUST NOT add undocumented routes or request fields
- The project MUST NOT use loosely typed unbounded JSON when a bounded schema can express the contract
- The project MUST NOT make internal Rust types the accidental public API
- The project MUST NOT silently change status codes, defaults, error meanings, or streaming framing

## Implementation guidance

Implementation MUST satisfy the applicable requirements above at the boundary where the risk or behavior is introduced. A wrapper, UI-only check, documentation statement, or downstream compensating check does not satisfy a requirement when the rule requires enforcement at a lower or authoritative boundary. Keep implementation choices consistent with the domain sources in the reference trail; document approved deviations instead of silently weakening the control.

## Assessment procedure

Assess both design and operation. Use the methods below as appropriate to the control and retain enough context for another reviewer to reproduce the determination.

### Examine

- Inspect the relevant specification, source, configuration, dependency/build metadata, tests, and operational documentation to confirm the requirement is addressed at the stated boundary.
- Confirm the change is traceable to the requirement IDs listed above and that any conditions, limits, defaults, failure behavior, and exceptions are explicit.

### Interview

- When a requirement depends on an operational role or manual procedure, interview the accountable owner and confirm the described procedure matches the approved documentation and observed practice. An interview alone does not establish effectiveness when implementation or behavior can be examined or tested.

### Test

- Validate the OpenAPI document in CI. Test schema constraints and representative success, client error, authorization error, server error, and compatibility cases against the running handler.
- Exercise at least one negative or failure case for each security, compatibility, resource, or reliability boundary affected by the change; confirm the observed result matches the contract and does not bypass the control.
- Record the command or procedure, tested revision and environment, result, and any limitation. A skipped check is not passing evidence.

## Assessment determination

A control document passes only when every applicable MUST requirement is implemented and supported by current evidence, each applicable SHOULD deviation has a documented rationale, and no unapproved or expired exception remains. A requirement fails when implementation is absent, behavior contradicts the requirement, evidence is missing or stale, or the assessment cannot reproduce the claimed result. Record **pass**, **fail**, or **not applicable** per control ID; “not applicable” requires a stated condition and reviewer rationale.

## Required evidence

- A reviewable change or design artifact identifying the applicable control IDs and requirement IDs.
- Automated test, CI result, or documented manual assessment showing the expected behavior, including relevant negative cases.
- A recorded exception with owner, rationale, compensating measures, approval, and expiry when a control cannot be met.

## Exceptions and nonconformance

A deviation from a MUST requirement requires explicit approval from the accountable product or engineering owner before release. The exception record MUST identify affected controls, scope, risk, compensating measures, remediation owner, and expiry or review date. A SHOULD deviation MUST include a rationale and impact in the change record. Unapproved or expired deviations are nonconformances and MUST block the affected release when the requirement is release-critical.

## Reference trail

R1 defines a language-independent HTTP interface description; R2 supplies security verification controls for API behavior. The full source mapping is in [00-references-trails.md](../trails/00-references-trails.md).
